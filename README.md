# FFXIV-Price-Graph-Drawer
Keep track of prices and draw histograms using date-price value pairs.

Histograms are drawn with XChart https://github.com/timmolter/XChart

Project on hold. Unless it becomes possible to automatically fetch price information - in a way that does not violate FFXIV's rules - project will probably stay on hold.
